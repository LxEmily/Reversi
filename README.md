# Reversi 

COMP10050 Software Engineering Project I Assignment 3

Collaboratively create a program Reversi game logic in C. 

After implementing Reversi's board initialization in Assignment 2, this program should have the following game logic:
1. A starting condition of 4 disks on board (2 black, 2 white).
2. Compute possible moves for each player, prompt player for move, and place disk accordingly.
3. Print game result and save to file.

Additionally, 
- Use Git to collaborate (original submission was on GitLab).
- Comment and separate code into independent modules.

The documentation.pdf contains
1. How we decided to implement the game logic
2. How we divided the work
3. What each function did and how they're structured
